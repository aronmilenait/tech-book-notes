# Notes on Technical Books
This repository stores my notes on technical books that I've read or that I'm reading. The purpose is to share the most fundamental aspects of them, with summaries and personal notes.

# ⚙️ Project's structure
Each folder is named after the book's title and contains a .md file, which has all the notes and summaries.
